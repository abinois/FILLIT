Dear user,

we understand you are doing your best to make this work. Sadly it appears that
it still is not enough.

Here is what you're supposed to do (to be honest, it's really REALLY easy, I'm 
astonished by your unability to make this work, but whatever):

Please provide a valid pathname to a file containing valid tetrimino pieces. You
may ask: "But, what is a valid tetrimino file, dear computer?".

A valid tetrimino file: every Tetrimino must exactly fit in a 4 by 4 chars
square and all Tetriminos are separated by a newline.

A valid tetrimino must respect the following rules:

- Precisely 4 lines of 4 characters, each followed by a new line
- A Tetrimino is a classic piece of Tetris composed of 4 blocks
- Each character must be either a block char ('#') or an empty char ('.')
- Each block must touch at least one other block on one of his four sides
